      Navajo Code Talkers Receiving a Message
    </div>
  <p>At the advent of the United States' involvement in World War II, the necessity for communications security was obvious. American and Japanese military forces had broken enemy codes repeatedly and without a level of difficulty either would find appropriate. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, a large number of Navajo men enlisted in the American army. Despite the past treatment and general view of Native Americans by the American people, the Navajo men still saw an attack on America as an attack on them. They enlisted not knowing they would eventually serve a vital role in the Pacific front. Thirty Navajo men made up the first group of trainees, with twenty-nine of them eventually moving into active duty.</p>
	<p>As a moderate percentage of Japanese troops were educated in America and fully understood English, American codes wer easily broken. Navajo served as a perfect replacement code for military communications for a number of reasons. It was estimated that there were at most 30 non-Navajo people who could understand Navajo at the beginning of World War II. The Navajo men also demonstrated proficiency in communications, transmitting a three line message in 20 seconds. It would take machinery of the time 30 minutes to complete the same transaction less securely.  Additionally, Navajo was, at the time, an unwritten language. This made the probability of the existence of a bilingual very low while also severly hindering any attempts at distributional analysis. While certainly not literally unbreakable, the Navajo language may have been practically unbreakable as military code.</p>
	<p>Four guidelines for Navajo code creation were put into place to guarantee both security and smooth communication. The first said that any code word must have a logical connection to the concept being encoded. The second said that codes were to be unusually descriptive or creative to make memorization easier. The third said codes had to be relatively short. The fourth said to avoid words that may be confused with other words in context. Ultimately, this led to irregular Navajo language that may have been impossible for even a native Navajo speaker to truly understand. The Navajo code helped American troops to most notably take Iwo Jima and win the Pacific front. As the code was held classified until 1968, it is safe to assume that the Navajo code was unbroken.</p>
